# AGENTS.md

## Agent instructions

- You are consulted for training planning and analysing past sessions
- always consider athlete's background and injury history but don't be too conservative, we can plan take risks in planing as the athlete is experienced and will adjust the workout if it does not feel good
- Be concise and to the point with your responses
- Do not try to be a motivator but rather an analyst, objective and straightforward with criticism

## Athlete Background & Long-Term Context

This document provides persistent background context about the athlete for AI agents.
It is intended to be treated as stable historical truth unless explicitly updated.

The athlete has a long competitive endurance background combined with extensive
strength and CrossFit experience. Training decisions should respect both domains
and their interaction.

## Personal Information

- Year of birth: **1985**
- Athletic background: **Endurance running & strength / CrossFit**
- Competitive athlete with decades of structured training experience

## Running History

### Early & Competitive Background
- Started running regularly at approximately **12 years old**
- Joined a **running club at age 16**
- Has competed regularly in running events since adolescence
- At his peak, the athlete was well above average and competitive in stronger local and regional fields, occasionally near the sharp end, but less so in deeper, higher-tier regional competitions.
- He was a strong regional-to-upper-club level middle-distance runner with excellent endurance, solid speed, and high competitive consistency, but not national elite.  
- His profile was that of a strength and endurance based middle-distance runner rather than a speed-dominant type.

### Primary Running Focus (Historically)
- Main competitive distance: **1500 m**
- Additional race distances:
  - 800 m
  - Up to 10 km
- Rare participation in shorter sprint distances
- Occasional half marathons, **never with primary competitive focus**

---

## Running Training Characteristics

### Historical Running Load
- During endurance-focused phases:
  - Regular **~80 km per week**
  - Typically **6 running sessions per week**, especially in winter/base periods
- During track season:
  - Reduced mileage
  - Increased emphasis on intensity and race-specific sessions

### Training Structure Over the Years
- Consistently trained **~5 sessions per week**
- Training focus varied over time, but:
  - **At least one high-intensity running session per week** was almost always present
- Demonstrates long-term tolerance to structured and demanding run training

### Recent Running Context
- Over the last ~4 years:
  - Training bias shifted toward **strength and CrossFit**
  - Aerobic conditioning was maintained but **gradually declined** relative to peak running years
- Since **2024**:
  - Able to run **at least once per week** without major injury setbacks
  - Running load requires careful management and progression

### Current Running Constraints
- Running frequency is currently limited by **injury management**, not motivation
- Requires consistent **prehab** to tolerate running load:
  - Ankles
  - Knees
- Sudden increases in volume or intensity increase injury risk

---

## Transition to CrossFit & Strength Training

- In **late 2012**, began CrossFit due to:
  - Recurring **ankle issues**
- Since then:
  - Regular **CrossFit participation**
  - Regular **strength training** (barbell lifts and accessories)

### Injury Context During This Period
- Continued attempts to run alongside CrossFit
- Recurrent issues limiting consistent running:
  - Ankles
  - Calves
  - Achilles tendon

---

## CrossFit & Strength Training Characteristics

### Strength Bias Period
- Over the last ~4 years:
  - Training emphasis primarily on **strength and CrossFit**
  - Conditioning work present but secondary
- Strength base is well-developed relative to current endurance fitness

### CrossFit Competition History
- Participated in the **CrossFit Open every year since 2013**
- Limited participation in other CrossFit competitions until **recent years**

### Recent Competitive Focus (since 2025)
- Increased participation in **CrossFit competitions**
- Returned to **1500 m track competitions**
- Current athletic identity combines:
  - Middle-distance running
  - Strength and mixed-modal competition demands

---

## Shoulder Health Context

- Performs **regular shoulder prehab / rehab**
- No major shoulder injuries
- Occasional mild shoulder pain:
  - Requires load awareness
  - Exercise selection and volume management
- Shoulders are functional but should not be treated as fully injury-agnostic

---

## Key Characteristics for AI Agents

- Athlete has **decades of endurance training history**
- Strength and power qualities are highly developed
- Injury history is relevant for:
  - Load management
  - Running frequency decisions
  - Exercise selection
- Running and CrossFit are **co-equal performance goals**
- Training decisions should emphasize:
  - Sequencing of stressors
  - Sustainability over short-term peaks
  - Preservation of running consistency

---

## Usage Notes for AI Agents

AI agents should:
- Assume high movement literacy and body awareness
- Avoid beginner-level explanations unless explicitly requested
- Consider cumulative fatigue across running, strength, and CrossFit
- Treat prehab and rehab as **mandatory system constraints**
- Optimize interaction between endurance and strength, not exclusion of either
