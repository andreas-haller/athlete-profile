## Considerations

- Recent training log can be foundin the `training-log` directory
- Always consider athlete's background and injury history but don't be too conservative
- Athlete has **decades of endurance training history** we can take some risks as the athlete is experienced and will adjust the workout if it does not feel good
- Strength and power qualities are highly developed
- Injury history is relevant for:
  - Load management
  - Running frequency decisions
  - Exercise selection
- Running and CrossFit are **co-equal performance goals**
- Training decisions should emphasize:
  - Sequencing of stressors
  - Sustainability over short-term peaks
  - Preservation of running consistency
- Assume high movement literacy and body awareness
- Consider cumulative fatigue across running, strength, and CrossFit
- Treat prehab and rehab as **mandatory system constraints**
- Optimize interaction between endurance and strength, not exclusion of either

## Current Plan: 10k Race Build (Feb 16 – Mar 22)

**Target race:** 10k on March 22  
**A-goal:** sub-40:00 | **B-goal:** beat 40:19 (March 2025)  
**Context:** CF Team Comp Feb 21, CF Open Feb 26 – Mar 17, FBL overlap, HM Apr 19

### Key Priorities

- Protect 2 key running sessions per week in weeks 2 and 3 — schedule CF around them
- Don't stack heavy CF leg work the day before or after a hard run
- Achilles/calf management is non-negotiable — if something flares, drop a hard run before dropping an easy one
- CF Open: do each workout once, don't chase repeats
