# Athlete Profile

This is a repository created by and containing information of Andreas Haller. It is used as a context for AI to help with training planning, analysis and more. There is actually a second, private repository containing the more sensitive information.

The goal is to have a chat with AI about all facets of my Sports career and get guidance. I am also very lazy if it comes to training logs and with some integrations to for example Stava this helps me to properly log my workouts with minimum effort.
